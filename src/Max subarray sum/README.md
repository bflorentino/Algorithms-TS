## Max SubArray Sum

Write an algorithm to get the largest possible sum of a sequence of consecutive values in an array.

For example in: [-1, 2, 4, -3, 5, 2, -5, 2]

The maximun sum of a subarray is 10, with next subarray: [2, 4, -3, 5, 2, -5, 2]

Take into account if the array is empty the max sum would be 0

Try to solve this problem in a time complexity at most of O(n)
