## Programming exercises in TypeScript

These are algorithms developed in typescript. These exercises can be found in different sources such as Codewars,HackerRank, CodeSignal, and other ones.

Most of the exercises have unit tests, to make sure algorithms work properly. Exercises have as well a README file which explains what the exercise is about and what results are expected.
